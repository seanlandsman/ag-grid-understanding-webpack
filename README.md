# Example for [Webpack Tutorial: Understanding How it Works](https://www.ag-grid.com/ag-grid-understanding-webpack/)

## To make this example work
You will need `Node.js` (https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
`npm` is package manager for it.

1) `git clone https://github.com/seanlandsman/ag-grid-understanding-webpack.git`
2) `cd ag-grid-understanding-webpack`
3) `npm install` installs packages listed in `packages.json`, so Webpack can use or bundle them.
4) `node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js` will let Webpack do it's work
